## **Overview**

In this demo, I practiced preprocessing and building predictive models in the pyspark module. 
I took dataset from my [imdb_project](https://github.com/willtseng12/metis_projects_17/tree/master/imdb_project) and re-implemented similar preprocessing steps and linear modeling techniques on the data.
